# Project Name
## Project #36 from Codecademy's Full Stack Engineer Career Path
### By Anton Vlasenko (AntonV0)  
## Project Outline
This project focuses on making Document Object Model (DOM) events to create a basic piano player. The user can practice their piano skills by following the "Happy Birthday" song notes. Clicking the "line" button displays the next song line, changing the piano keys using DOM events.
## What I Learned
  - The syntax and use cases for DOM events
  - Functions that modify CSS using event.target.style
  - Assigning these functions as the values of event handler properties
  - Events such as onclick, onmousedown, and onmouseup
  - The forEach() method to loop through each array element
  - Using document.getElementById to access specific HTML elements
  - Adding the .hidden property to event handler properties to decide what information to display
